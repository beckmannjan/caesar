## Caesar
This is a very simple program for very simple encryption, the Caeser cipher. I just did this for practice and fun so it is probably full of bugs. Nevertheless, if you want to use it, feel free to (as per license). It will work on it from time to time, as I learn.

#### Some features that may or may not come in the future:
- graphical interface (in OpenGL)
- other deriviates of the caeser cipher (ROT13, Vigen√®re cipher)
- better syntax
- etc., just some random things for practise
